## Please describe the activity that should be considered for the open science award (200 words). You can include links to relevant resources. 

The “Open-source software for surgical technologies” workshop comprised a half-day session during which I had the privilege of hosting seven distinguished speakers.  

These experts hailed from diverse domains including software engineering in medical imagining, academics specialising in surgical data science, and researchers at the forefront of surgical technology development.  

Speakers presented their research, development and experiences; shared insights from developmental process and recounted their experiences in adopting to the rapid innovation of new technologies.  

Through the workshop, speakers delved into the intricate challenges posed by research-driven technologies. These challenges encompassed navigating the utilisation of cutting-edge hardware; fast prototyping and validation of new algorithms; maintaining of fragmented source code for heterogenous systems; developing high performance of medical image computing and visualisation in the operating room and discussing benchmarks of data quality and data privacy.  

We subsequently convened a panel discussion, underscoring the pressing need of additional guidelines and platform. 

Such resources would enable researchers to glean best practices, ensuring that open-source software libraries are not only sustainable but also receive long-term support and are seamlessly translatable to clinic settings.  

Recording of the talks and presentations, along with a work-in-progress white paper and links to forums for inviting others to join our community can be accessed here https://github.com/oss-for-surgtech  


## Please describe how the activity has either a)    systematically implemented open science practices b)    enhanced the adoption of open science, c)    increased the impact of open science, d)    innovated open science practices, e)    used open access resources, especially textbooks, in teaching (300 words) 

 

The following points outline how the “Open-source software for surgical technologies” workshop contributed to aspects a) through e), highlighting the significance of open-source software in advancing open science: 

 

a) The foundations of open science are built upon principles of reproductivity and transparency.  

These principles align with the tenets of good software practices which necessitate robustness, understandability, extensibility, modularity, maintainability, and reusability. Thys, during the workshop, the speakers not only showcased real-world applications that adhere to these sound software practices, but also highlighted the associated challenges of incorporating cutting-edge software and hardware technologies.  

 

b) We enhanced the adoption of open science by initiating with a small community of 13 individuals through our Discord channel, accompanied by the creation of an openly accessible white paper https://github.com/oss-for-surgtech/white-paper  

 

c) We amplify the influence of open science by disseminating recorded presentations from the workshop's speakers to our target audience of researchers, engineers and clinicians.  

This effort enables individuals from all corners of the globe to gain a comprehensive grasp of the ongoing advances and challenges associated with integrating open-source software technologies alongside the latest hardware and software releases. https://github.com/oss-for-surgtech/workshop-hamlyn2023  

 

d) The workshop has innovated open science practices by orchestrating a workshop at the Hamlyn symposium that not only featured esteemed speakers but also garnered industry attention (e.g., kuka robotics, b-brown medical Ltd, and karlstorz Ltd).  

 

e) Reflecting on the scientific contributions of Prlić et al. in the article "Ten simple rules for the open development of scientific software," published in 2012, as well as O'Reilly, Tim article, "Lessons from open-source software development," published in 1999, my collaborators and I engaged in meaningful discussion with the speakers. These conversations delved into the future prospects and challenges surrounding community cultivation, while also exploring the nuanced boundaries between commercial development and the community-driven open-source initiatives.
